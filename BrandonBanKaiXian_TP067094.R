# Explanation:
# The occupation of meat cutter has the highest proportion of employees who retire, with produce clerk following closely behind, 
# while the cashier role has the highest proportion of employees who resigned.
# Meat cutting is a physically demanding job that requires a certain level of strength and stamina. 
# As employees age, it may become more difficult for them to perform the tasks required of them, leading to retirement. 
# On the other hand, cashiering involves standing for long periods and repetitive tasks, which can lead to boredom and burnout, 
# especially for younger employees who may be seeking more challenging and fulfilling work

Q1_3()

# Explanation:
# Based on the graph shown above,  we can conclude that meat cutters tend to retire after a longer period of service compared to cashiers, who are more likely to resign after a shorter period of work
# The reason behind this might be jobs, such as cashiering, may be mentally demanding due to the need to interact with customers and handle money accurately
# This could lead to burnout or stress, which could also result in employees leaving the job earlier or being terminated.
# The job of meat cutter demands a particular skill set and expertise, which suggests that it may take a considerable amount of time (usually 2-5 years) for them to attain the required level of proficiency. 
# This factor could be one of the reasons behind the higher retirement rate among meat cutters after serving for a longer duration.
#------------------------------- Conclusion ---------------------------------------
# In conclusion, the factors associated with employee termination can be attributed to various reasons based on age, occupation, and job demands. 
# Employees aged 60 and above are more likely to retire, while those between 20 and 35 are more likely to resign due to exploring other career opportunities, 
# seeking higher pay, or furthering their education. Layoffs, on the other hand, can happen across all age ranges and are not specific to any particular age group. 
# Occupation-wise, the meat cutter role has the highest proportion of employees who retire, while cashiers are more likely to resign. 
# This could be due to the physically demanding nature of meat cutting, which requires a particular skill set and expertise that may take time to develop, leading to retirement after a longer period of service. 
# In contrast, cashiering involves standing for long periods and repetitive tasks that can lead to burnout or stress, resulting in employees leaving the job earlier or being terminated. 
# Understanding these factors is essential for employers to develop strategies to retain employees and reduce the cost associated with high turnover rates.

Q2_3()

# Explanation:
# Millennial employees, irrespective of gender, have been laid off in the largest numbers. 
# This could be attributed to companies laying off employees as a cost-saving measure, 
# and younger employees being more vulnerable due to their lower salaries and less experience. 
# The adoption of new technologies is leading to the automation of many jobs, which may be a contributing factor to layoffs. 
# As millennial are often in entry-level positions, they may be more impacted by these changes.

#------------------------------- Conclusion ------------------------------------
# Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that several factors contributed to the high rate of employee layoffs. 
# Customer service and job categories such as cashier and dairy person have been hit the hardest due to the ease of outsourcing or automation. 
# On the other hand, store management positions, which are critical to the success of the company, had the lowest number of layoffs.
# Furthermore, millennial employees, who are often in entry-level positions, have been laid off in the largest numbers. 
# Companies may lay off employees as a cost-saving measure, and younger employees are more vulnerable due to their lower salaries and less experience. 
# The adoption of new technologies and the resulting automation of many jobs could also be a contributing factor to layoffs.
# Overall, these findings suggest that companies are likely looking to cut costs by automating jobs or outsourcing them to other countries. 
# This trend is likely to continue, impacting entry-level employees and those in job categories that are more easily replaceable. 
# To mitigate the impact of these changes, companies may need to invest in retraining programs and support for affected employees to transition to new roles or industries.

# female employees are more likely to be employed in job roles with different retirement patterns compared to those of male employees.
# Moreover, meat cutter is the job role with the highest number of employees above the age of 60 for both male and female, but a higher number of female 
# employees had left the job compared to male employees, possibly due to the physical demands of the job becoming more challenging with increasing age.
# It is noteworthy that Vancouver had the highest number of terminated female employees, which may be attributed to a decline in the jobs, such as meat cutter, where female employees were more represented, 
# resulting in higher termination rates.

# Explanation:
# The cashier job appears to be the most commonly terminated position among millennials and gen X, while meat cutter is the most commonly terminated job among baby boomers. 
# Additionally, the dairy person job is another position that appears to have a high termination rate among gen X.
# This trend may be attributed to changes in the retail industry and organizational policies, resulting in a decrease in demand for these positions. 
# Moreover, employees may have opted for better job opportunities offering higher pay, benefits, and career advancement prospects.

# Explanation:
# The high termination rates observed among millennials in the cashier job, gen X in the dairy person and cashier jobs, and baby boomers in the meat cutter job may be attributed to various factors. 
# Millennials may have left the cashier job to seek better employment opportunities with improved compensation, benefits, and career growth prospects. 
# Gen X may have experienced job loss due to automation and technological advancements in the industry. 
# Baby boomers, on the other hand, may have retired due to age or personal preferences for a reduced workload.

#------------------------------- Conclusion ------------------------------------
# In conclusion, the decrease in total employee count since 2013 varies across different generations. Millennials may have resigned from cashier jobs to 
# seek better employment opportunities, while gen X may have faced job loss due to automation and technological advancements. 
# Baby boomers may have opted to retire due to age or personal preferences for a reduced workload.

}
Q5_1()

# Explanation:
# The trend of the average length of service shows a decline from 2009 to 2011, 
# possibly due to the global recession leading to higher termination rates and shorter service periods for terminated employees.
# However, from 2011 to 2015, there was a rapid increase in the average length of service, 
# which may be attributed to the economic recovery and increased hiring during that period.

}
Q5_2()

# Explanation:
# Based on the graph, it can be observed that the average length of service is the shortest for the customer service department, 
# followed by the dairy and processed foods departments. 
# This trend may be attributed to the possibility that these departments have a relatively larger number of entry-level positions 
# that tend to attract younger and less experienced employees who may be more prone to leaving their jobs sooner.

#---- Analysis 5.3 - Find the relationship between average length of service and cities ----

}
Q5_3()

# Explanation:
# Based on the graph, it can be observed that "Ocean Falls" is the city with the longest average length of service.
# rephrase professionally, " the average length of service in the city "Ocean Falls" is the longest, 
# this may be that the company in this city may have a strong presence and good reputation in the community, 
# leading to higher job satisfaction and loyalty among employees.

#------------------------------- Conclusion ------------------------------------
# The average length of service for terminated employees varies significantly depending on the year, department, and city. 
# By analyzing these variations, companies can gain valuable insights into factors that contribute to employee retention and 
# implement strategies to improve employee loyalty and reduce turnover rates.
