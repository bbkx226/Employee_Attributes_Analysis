# Explanation:

# Meat cutting is a physically demanding job that requires a certain level of strength and stamina.

Q1_3()

# Explanation:
# Based on the graph shown above,  we can conclude that meat cutters tend to retire after a longer period of service compared to cashiers, who are more likely to resign after a shorter period of work
# The reason behind this might be jobs, such as cashiering, may be mentally demanding due to the need to interact with customers and handle money accurately
# This could lead to burnout or stress, which could also result in employees leaving the job earlier or being terminated.
# The job of meat cutter demands a particular skill set and expertise, which suggests that it may take a considerable amount of time (usually 2-5 years) for them to attain the required level of proficiency. 
# This factor could be one of the reasons behind the higher retirement rate among meat cutters after serving for a longer duration.

# Explanation:
# The analysis revealed that the job role with the greatest number of female employees over the age of 60 in 2014 was that of a storage manager.

# for female employees as they age, leading to a higher probability of termination. 
# Additionally, it was observed that there were only a little numbers of male employees aged 60 in 2014,
