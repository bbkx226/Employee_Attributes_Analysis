# Meat cutting is a physically demanding job that requires a certain level of strength and stamina. 
# As employees age, it may become more difficult for them to perform the tasks required of them, leading to retirement. 
# On the other hand, cashiering involves standing for long periods and repetitive tasks, which can lead to boredom and burnout,

Q1_3()

# Explanation:
# Based on the graph shown above,  we can conclude that meat cutters tend to retire after a longer period of service compared to cashiers, who are more likely to resign after a shorter period of work
# The reason behind this might be jobs, such as cashiering, may be mentally demanding due to the need to interact with customers and handle money accurately
# This could lead to burnout or stress, which could also result in employees leaving the job earlier or being terminated.
# The job of meat cutter demands a particular skill set and expertise, which suggests that it may take a considerable amount of time (usually 2-5 years) for them to attain the required level of proficiency. 
# This factor could be one of the reasons behind the higher retirement rate among meat cutters after serving for a longer duration.

#------------------------------- Conclusion -----------------------------------
# In conclusion, the factors associated with employee termination can be attributed to various reasons based on age, occupation, and job demands. 
# Employees aged 60 and above are more likely to retire, while those between 20 and 35 are more likely to resign due to exploring other career opportunities, 
# seeking higher pay, or furthering their education. Layoffs, on the other hand, can happen across all age ranges and are not specific to any particular age group. 
# Occupation-wise, the meat cutter role has the highest proportion of employees who retire, while cashiers are more likely to resign. 
# This could be due to the physically demanding nature of meat cutting, which requires a particular skill set and expertise that may take time to develop, leading to retirement after a longer period of service. 
# In contrast, cashiering involves standing for long periods and repetitive tasks that can lead to burnout or stress, resulting in employees leaving the job earlier or being terminated. 
# Understanding these factors is essential for employers to develop strategies to retain employees and reduce the cost associated with high turnover rates.

Q2_3()

# Explanation:
# Millennial employees, irrespective of gender, have been laid off in the largest numbers. 
# This could be attributed to companies laying off employees as a cost-saving measure, 
# and younger employees being more vulnerable due to their lower salaries and less experience. 
# The adoption of new technologies is leading to the automation of many jobs, which may be a contributing factor to layoffs. 
# As millennial are often in entry-level positions, they may be more impacted by these changes.
# Many members of the Silent Generation are retired and not actively participating in the workforce. 
# This could result in them being less affected by layoffs compared to other generations.

#------------------------------- Conclusion ------------------------------------
# Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that several factors contributed to the high rate of employee layoffs. 
# Customer service and job categories such as cashier and dairy person have been hit the hardest due to the ease of outsourcing or automation. 
# On the other hand, store management positions, which are critical to the success of the company, had the lowest number of layoffs.
# Furthermore, millennial employees, who are often in entry-level positions, have been laid off in the largest numbers. 
# Companies may lay off employees as a cost-saving measure, and younger employees are more vulnerable due to their lower salaries and less experience. 
# The adoption of new technologies and the resulting automation of many jobs could also be a contributing factor to layoffs.
# Overall, these findings suggest that companies are likely looking to cut costs by automating jobs or outsourcing them to other countries. 
# This trend is likely to continue, impacting entry-level employees and those in job categories that are more easily replaceable. 
# To mitigate the impact of these changes, companies may need to invest in retraining programs and support for affected employees to transition to new roles or industries.

# Explanation:
# The analysis revealed that the job role with the greatest number of female employees over the age of 60 in 2014 was that of a storage manager. 
# This trend may be attributed to the physically demanding nature of the job, which requires endurance and strength that may become more challenging 
# for female employees as they age, leading to a higher probability of termination. 
# Additionally, it was observed that there were only a little numbers of male employees aged 60 in 2014, 
# possibly due to a retirement or layoff program that targeted male employees in this age group.

Q3_4()

# Explanation:
# The graph suggests that female employees in Vancouver were mostly terminated from their roles as recruiters, whereas in Fort Nelson, 
# female employees were predominantly terminated from their positions as meat cutters and dairy persons. 
# This discrepancy in termination rates could potentially be due to gender bias, 
# where female employees in these industries may be subject to negative stereotypes and be viewed as less capable than their male counterparts, 
# leading to higher rates of termination.

#------------------------------- Conclusion ------------------------------------
# Based on the analyses conducted, it can be concluded that there are differences in the number of terminated employees by gender. 
# Specifically, older female employees are more likely to retire compared to older male employees, which may be due to the fact that 
# female employees are more likely to be employed in job roles with different retirement patterns compared to those of male employees.
# Moreover, meat cutter is the job role with the highest number of employees above the age of 60 for both male and female, but a higher number of female 
# employees had left the job compared to male employees, possibly due to the physical demands of the job becoming more challenging with increasing age.
# It is noteworthy that Vancouver had the highest number of terminated female employees, which may be attributed to a decline in the jobs, such as meat cutter, where female employees were more represented, 
# resulting in higher termination rates.

# Explanation:

# Explanation:
# Based on the graph, it can be observed that "Ocean Falls" is the city with the longest average length of service.

#------------------------------- Conclusion -----------------------------------
# The average length of service for terminated employees varies significantly depending on the year, department, and city. 
# By analyzing these variations, companies can gain valuable insights into factors that contribute to employee retention and 
# implement strategies to improve employee loyalty and reduce turnover rates.
