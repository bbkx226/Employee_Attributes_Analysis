# Observation:
# The termination rates for Store 35 between 2009 and 2011 may have been affected by multiple elements,
# such as alterations in the job market, staff maintenance regulations, job pleasure, staff demographics,
# and other components such as developments in technology or industry tendencies. Consider a scenario where there
# was a labor shortage in a specific year. Due to the high expense of acquiring new employees, the business may have
# been more ready to fire employees in this situation. Alternately, the business may have established strategies or plans to
# keep workers around, such providing rewards or chances for professional growth, which might have prevented as many layoffs as it caused.
# The level of employee engagement and satisfaction may also affect turnover rates. Employees may have been less likely to leave the organization
# in a specific year if they were happy with their jobs.

# The findings revealed that baby boomers saw the highest percentage of employment loss, while Gen X experienced the lowest rate.
# Several theories can be offered to account for this disparity. Baby boomers are older workers; thus, some may decide to retire,
# which would lead to an increase in termination rate. Due to their propensity to work in occupations or industries that are touched
# by economic or technological advancement, baby boomers may be at danger of losing their employment. The Gen X workforce, on the other hand,
# is in its peak years of employment and may enjoy more job stability as a result of their longer tenure with their companies.
